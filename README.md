# Tremollo
This is from the To-Do List assignment from The Odin Project. 

The user can create, read, edit, and delete to-do lists as well as their items. Each item has a title, description, due date utilizing [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), and priority. Data is stored in Local Storage so it can be accessed later.
