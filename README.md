# Tremollo
A To-Do List management tool, inspired by Trello.

The user can create, read, edit, and delete to-do lists as well as their items. Each item has a title, description, due date utilizing [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/), and priority. Data is stored in Local Storage so it can be accessed later.
